# Espcontrol

**A no-code, super-easy-to-configure smart home controller.** Configure affordable touchscreens to control devices across your entire smart home — no ESPHome setup, no YAML, no code to write. Just flash, connect, and start adding buttons.

Espcontrol is free, open-source firmware that turns **Guition ESP32** touchscreens into beautiful control panels for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It comes with **full documentation** and an **easy-to-use web installer** — you can go from unboxing to a working wall panel in minutes.

Supported panels include the **7-inch JC1060P470** (1024×600, landscape, 20 buttons), the **4.3-inch JC4880P443** (480×800, portrait, 15 buttons), and the **4-inch 4848S040** (480×480, square, 9 buttons). Each panel uses a fixed grid layout sized to its screen, plus a status bar with a clock and temperatures, a screensaver, automatic brightness, and **over-the-air updates**. After the first install, everything is configured through the device's **built-in web page**.

## Features

- **Grid layout** — a fixed grid sized to each screen so you can place buttons exactly where you want them
- **Subpages** — group related controls into folders to keep the home screen tidy
- **Double-height buttons** — span any button across two rows for easier tapping and greater prominence
- **Edit controls** — drag-and-drop ordering, bulk select, and copy-paste between pages from the built-in web UI
- **Screensaver** — dims and sleeps after a set time, or wakes automatically from a presence sensor
